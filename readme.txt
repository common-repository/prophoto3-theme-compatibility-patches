Requires at least: 3.2
Tested up to: 3.3
License: GPLv2

Only for users of version 3 of the <a href="http://www.prophotoblogs.com/">ProPhoto</a> theme. Contains patches required for compatibility with WordPress 3.3+

== Description ==

As of September 27, 2011, ProPhoto3 is no longer under active development, or available for download, only ProPhoto version 4.

ProPhoto version 3 will still be actively supported until ProPhoto version 5 is released at an unknown future date. Any required patches for bug fixes or WordPress version compatibility issues will be handled through this plugin, instead of releasing changes to the ProPhoto3 theme itself. Everyone still using ProPhoto version 3 is required to install this plugin and keep it updated to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of WordPress as they are released.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your blog, or install it through the Plugins page, then activate it and forget about it.
